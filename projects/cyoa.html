            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>In this unit of SEP10, we learned about Git commands and command lines. We learned how GitHub works and practiced linking files on GitHub.com and collaborating with others through the CYOA project. For my CYOA project, I needed to work with a partner to create an interactive story about the topic we were assigned.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>My partner (Keith) and I were assigned to the topic "Stuck in a videogame," and we have decided to create a Life Simulator Game. The game was about a main character born into a rich family, and every decision he made was a turning point in his life. The player will act for the main character and decide what actions the main character will take when facing an obstacle. Keith and I created background stories to tell the player the important moments of the character's life and give the player options to take. We have created three different life endings, and the ending that appears will depend on the player's decision.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>My teacher assigned this project to let us work on linking files on GitHub.com and collaborating with peers. He also wanted us to use our knowledge of Git commands and command lines in our project. This project helped me practice link files because I needed to create files for the important moments of the character's life and let the files jump to another file when the player had picked an option. The project helped my communication skills by allowing me to talk to others. I need to explain my thoughts to my partner to agree on what we should put on our project.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> The challenge that my partner and I faced was we could not agree on what story we should make when we first knew about our topic because we did not play video games. We overcame this problem by asking our teacher what we could write about and looking at examples. I looked at the teacher's example of the project, and his story was about a person's day, so I came up with an idea that we could write about a person's life. </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>In this CYOA project, the main character was a rich man from the beginning. If I had more time, I would make being rich an option and create a whole new story about the main character being a poor man. Let the player decide if they want to start poor or wealthy. </p>
