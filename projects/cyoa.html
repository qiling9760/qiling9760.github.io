            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>In this unit of SEP10, we learned about Git commands and command lines. We learned about how GitHub works and practiced linking files on GitHub.com and collaborating with others through the CYOA project. For my CYOA project, I need to work with a partner to think up an interactive story about the topic that we were assigned to.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>My partner (Keith) and I were assigned to the topic "Stuk in a videogame", and we have decided to create a Life Simulator Game. The game was about a main character who was borned into a rich family and every dicision he made will be a turning point of his life. The player will act for the main character and decide what actions will the main character take when he face an obstacle. Keith and I created background stories to tell the player the important moment of the character's life and given the player options to take. We have created three different life endings, and the ending that appears will depend on the player's decision.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>My teacher assigned this project to up to let us work on linking files on GitHub.com and collaborating with peers. He also wanted us to use our knowledge of Git commands and command lines in our project. This project did help me in linking files because I need to create files for the immportant moment of the character's life and let the files jump to another file when the player had pick on an option. The project helped me in my communication skills because it give me an oppertunity to talk to others. I need to explain my thought to my partner in order to come up with an agreement on what we should put on out project.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>The challenge that my partner and I faced was we could not come up with an agreement on what story we should make when we first know about our topic because we did not play the video games. We overcame this problem by asking our teacher what can we write about and look at examples. I looked at the teacher's example of the project and his story was about a person's day, so I came up with an idea that we could write about a person's life. </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>In this CYOA project, the main character was a rich man from the beginning. If I had more time, I would make make being rich as an option and create a whole new story about the main chracter being a poor man. I would let the player decide if they want to start poor or wealthy. </p>
