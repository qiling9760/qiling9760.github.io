            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool. For my project, I chose to independently study Kaboom in order to make an interactive game where the player can control the character to collect points using their keyboard. My partner Ellen also learned Kaboom, and we combined what we learned to create this game. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>In the beginning of the year, my freinds and I wanted to create a game about cats. We then decided to separate into 2 groups and make the game into 2 parts. Part A of the game is about collecting cat food, and part B of the game is about using the cat food to get cats. After both teams finish, we will combine our games, so the cat food collected in part A can be used as currency in part B to obtain cats. Ellen and I were responsible for part A of the game.

            In my game, the player needs to use WASD or the arrow keys to move the character around. Each round will be 60 seconds, and the player needs to collect as many cat food as possible in this 60 seconds. The cat food will be randomly placed on the map, and the character needs to collide on it to collect it. The character will destroy the cat food when they collide on it, and a new cat food will appear on a different location of the map. There will be enemies moving across the map from left to right, and the player needs to avoid touching the enemies, or else the game will end. These enemies also steal the cat food if they collide on it.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>One of the challenges I faced in the beginning was after the character collects the first cat food, the next cat food did not appear on a different location of the map, instead, it stayed in the original posistion. I explained and record a video of my problem and asked on Slack. One of the SEP alumni told me that this problem occurred because my x and y values for the next cat food were the same as the previous cat food. So I fixed this problem by randomizing the x and y values each time a cat fod got destroyed. Another challenge was I did not know how to make my game end in 60 seconds. But luckly, I learned how use <code class="language-js">&lt;p&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/p&gt;</code> to make the end game function run after 60 seconds passed and <code class="language-js">&lt;p&gt;setInterval()&lt;/p&gt;</code> to make a timer from the internet.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>The takeaways I got from doing this project are communication skills and a growth mindset. Because I worked in a team, I need to talk wih my partner to divide the tasks. We also need to make agreements on what to include in our game. I also learned that I can ask help when I am stuck.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>We did not have enough time to combine our game. The cat food in my game did not work in part B of the game. If I had more time, I would actually connect our games, so the cat food can work.</p>
